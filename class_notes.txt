----------
Test Framework/Test Automation Framework/Test Harness/ -> collection of various tools, libraries and technologies that are brought together for running tests in automated fashion.

2 common types of test frameworks:
TDD(Test-Driven Development) -> TestNG based
BDD(Behavior-Driven Development) -> Cucumber+Junit based


Framework components:
Java -> write the entire automation code
Selenium -> write automation scripts for UI testing
WebDriverManager(bonigarcia) -> to automate the WebDriver setup and manage browser drivers
Maven -> manage dependencies, build the project / run the tests thru cmd
TestNG -> organize and configure the execution of the tests through annotations

---------------------------------------------

TestNG xml file - to control how we are running tests
TestBase class ->  a super class that holds common actions and variables to enable re-usability and maintainability
                    (configuration related methods with @Before, @After annotations)
                    When TestBase is used every test class must extend from TestBase
                    Usage of TestBase is an example of Inheritance

  Unit Tests -> white box tests that are created by devs,
  Integration Test -> tests that reveal bugs when individual components/units af the application are integrated together
  System Testing -> testing the system as a whole

  As a QA/SDET we are responsible for setting up, maintenance and execution of Smoke, Regression test suites.
  Smoke Test -> tests that cover critical functionalities of the Application,
  Regression Test -> tests that find out if the application has regression, usually includes all our tests and ran periodically, for example,
                        at the end of each sprint to find out if the newly added features didn't break the existing ones


  .gitignore file -> every project is going to have some folders and file/file types that are not relevant or pointless
                     to be version controlled such as .class files (bytcode), report folders/files. So to not to track them with we put them into a
                     file called .gitignore

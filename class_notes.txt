----------
Test Framework/Test Automation Framework/Test Harness/ -> collection of various tools, libraries and technologies that are brought together for running tests in automated fashion.

2 common types of test frameworks:
TDD(Test-Driven Development) -> TestNG based
BDD(Behavior-Driven Development) -> Cucumber+Junit based


Framework components:
Java -> write the entire automation code
Selenium -> write automation scripts for UI testing
WebDriverManager(bonigarcia) -> to automate the WebDriver setup and manage browser drivers
Maven -> manage dependencies, build the project / run the tests thru cmd
TestNG -> organize and configure the execution of the tests through annotations

---------------------------------------------

TestNG xml file - to control how we are running tests
TestBase class ->  a super class that holds common actions and variables to enable re-usability and maintainability
                    (configuration related methods with @Before, @After annotations)
                    When TestBase is used every test class must extend from TestBase
                    Usage of TestBase is an example of Inheritance

  Unit Tests -> white box tests that are created by developers, tests the individual units/components that are created by a developer
  Integration Test -> tests that reveal bugs when individual components/units af the application are integrated together, tests the application's integrated modules
  System Test -> tests that test the system as a whole, rather than individual components or integrated modules

  As a QA/SDET we are responsible for setting up, maintenance and execution of Smoke, Regression test suites.
  Smoke Test -> tests that cover critical functionalities of the Application,
  Regression Test -> tests that find out if the application has regression, usually includes all our tests and ran periodically, for example,
                        at the end of each sprint to find out if the newly added features didn't break the existing ones


  .gitignore file -> every project is going to have some folders and files/file types that are not relevant or pointless
                     to be version controlled such as .class files (bytecode), report files/folders, IDE files/folders. So in order not to track/ignore them with version control,
                     we put the names of those folders and files/file types into a file called .gitignore in each line and
                     add it to the root level of our project BEFORE starting to track the folder with version control (for example with Git, before git init)


   Hard vs Soft assertions -> hard assertions throw exception right away if they fail whereas soft assertions keep the execution and throw the exception, if any, at the end.
                              Mainly used when there are multiple assertions in a single test and tester would like to find out the result of all assertions

    How do you pass parameters to your method in TestNG?

    We can pass it through xml file by adding the parameters into the xml file with <parameter> tag first
    and then in our @Test method add @Parameters annotation
    NOTE: The order of parameter names in @Parameters annotation and the method parameters' order must match


    Data-Driven Testing - technique of running the same tests with different sets of data where data is fed from external sources
                          rather than being hardcoded into the test script.


    Test Coverage ->     percentage of implemented tests in relation to the requirements. Usually it should be above 80%.
                         You determine the test coverage with RTM(Requirements Traceability Matrix)

    Black-box testing techniques -> Boundary Value Analysis, Equivalence Partitioning
